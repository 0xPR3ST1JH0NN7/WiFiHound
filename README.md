  # WiFiHound

  **Interactive graph analysis for WiFi reconnaissance data.**
</div>

---

WiFiHound builds on the `aircrack-ng` suite and turns it into an explorable graph
of access points, clients and their associations, with live capture on top.
Import a CSV to analyze a past scan, or run a live capture and watch the network
map build in real time, deauth included.

- **Graph UI**: APs (red) and clients (blue) as nodes, associations as edges.
- **Explore**: search, filter (type, encryption, channel), node details, context actions.
- **Vendor enrichment** from the OUI, fully offline.
- **Live capture**: replay a loaded CSV, or stream a real `airodump-ng` capture over WebSocket.
- **Offensive** (opt in): deauth an AP or a single client during a live capture.

## Install

WiFiHound needs **Python 3.8+** (FastAPI does not run on Python 2). Always use
`python3` / `pip3` — on systems where a legacy Python 2 is still the default
`python`, a bare `pip install` targets Python 2.7 and fails with
`No matching distribution found for fastapi`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xPR3ST1JH0NN7/WiFiHound
cd WiFiHound
python3 -m venv .venv            # recommended: keep deps off the system Python
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # inside the venv, pip is Python 3's pip
```

Prefer not to use a virtualenv? Install straight into Python 3 instead:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Check what your `pip` targets with `pip --version`: the trailing
> `(python 3.x)` must be 3.8 or newer. If it says `(python 2.7)`, use
> `pip3` / `python3 -m pip` as shown above.

## Usage

```bash
python3 -m wifihound                 # opens http://127.0.0.1:8000
sudo python3 -m wifihound            # also unlocks live radio capture + deauth
```

(Inside an activated virtualenv you can just use `python -m wifihound`.)

There is one way to run it. Offline analysis and replay work unprivileged;
live radio capture and deauth turn on automatically when you start it with
**sudo** (root). No special flags.

Click **Import capture** and pick an `airodump-ng` CSV
(`airodump-ng -w scan --output-format csv wlan0mon`).

**Live capture** (sidebar, *Live capture* panel):

- **Replay**: import a CSV, then *Start live* to reveal it node by node. No privileges needed.
- **airodump**: stream a real capture. Choose interface, channel, protocol
  (WEP / WPA2 / WPA3 / Open), WPS, and an optional ESSID or BSSID filter.
  Needs root (run with sudo) and a monitor mode interface. WPA handshakes
  captured during the session (e.g. from a deauth) are flagged on the AP with a 🔑.

The reveal / poll speed is set by the *Interval* field.

## Offensive operations

Deauthentication runs `aireplay-ng -0 <count> -a <AP> [-c <client>]` on the live
capture interface. It is **only available while an airodump capture is running on
a fixed channel** (aireplay can reach the AP only on the interface's channel),
and stays behind its guardrails: requires root (run with sudo), confirmed per
action, with capped bursts and logging.

> ⚠️ Use only on networks you own or are explicitly authorized to test.
> Unauthorized deauthentication is illegal in most jurisdictions.

"""Wireless interface discovery and monitor-mode management.

Listing the wireless interfaces and reading their current mode is done straight
from ``sysfs`` (``/sys/class/net``), so it needs no privileges and no external
tools — handy for letting the user *pick* an interface instead of typing a name.

Switching an interface into monitor mode shells out to ``airmon-ng`` and so
carries the same guardrails as the rest of the offensive subsystem: it requires
root and the aircrack-ng suite on PATH.

"""Offensive-operation framework with hard guardrails.

These operations interact with *real* radio hardware and other people's
networks. They are therefore:

  * available only when the process runs as **root** (start WiFiHound with
    ``sudo``); there is no separate flag to toggle;
  * gated behind an explicit per-request authorization acknowledgement;
  * dependency-checked (the required external tools must exist);
  * logged.

Only use them on networks you own or are explicitly authorized in writing to
test. Unauthorized deauthentication / interception is illegal in most
jurisdictions.
